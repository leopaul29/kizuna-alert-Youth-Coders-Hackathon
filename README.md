# ÁµÜ Kizuna Alert

**Youth Coders Collective Hackathon 2025**

A community resilience web application for mutual aid during natural disasters in Japan.

## üéØ Project Objective

Kizuna (ÁµÜ) means "bond" or "connection" in Japanese. This application connects residents of the same Japanese neighborhood to:
- Receive real-time disaster alerts
- Share resources (water, food, shelter)
- Request help during emergencies
- Signal their safety to neighbors (check-in)
- Strengthen community solidarity

## üåê Language & Accessibility

**The entire application interface is now available in English** for broader accessibility and international reach. While maintaining Japanese cultural elements (such as the ÁµÜ kanji and Japanese neighborhood names), all user-facing text, alerts, and messages are presented in clear, professional English to ensure:
- Global accessibility for international users
- Clear communication during emergency situations
- Better demonstration for international hackathon judges
- Easier adoption for non-Japanese speaking communities

## üåü Hackathon Alignment

### Social Impact (Social Good)
- **Community Mutual Aid**: Facilitates solidarity between neighbors during crises

- **Inclusion**: Accessible to all neighborhood residents, regardless of age

### Function
- Simulated disaster alerts (earthquakes, typhoons, etc.)
- Neighborhood groups based on Japanese postal codes
- Community chat to share resources and information
- Check-in system to reassure neighbors

### Design
- Japanese **wabi-sabi** aesthetic: minimalist, clean, functional
- Calming color palette: blue, white, grey
- Intuitive and accessible interface

- Fully functional demo-ready application
- Complete documentation

## üöÄ How to Launch the Application on Replit

### Step 1: Open the Project
The project is already configured with all necessary files.

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Dependencies are automatically installed by Replit (Flask is already configured).

### Step 3: Launch the Application
Click the **Run** button or execute in the terminal:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Step 4: Test the Application
1. Open the application in your browser (use the provided Replit URL)
2. On the homepage, you'll see a simulated earthquake alert
3. Enter a Japanese postal code (e.g., `100-0001` for Chiyoda, Tokyo)
4. Access your neighborhood's community chat
5. View simulated resource-sharing messages
6. Click "I'm Safe" to simulate a safety check-in

## üé® Design Choices

### Wabi-Sabi Philosophy
Our design embodies the Japanese aesthetic of **wabi-sabi** ‚Äî finding beauty in imperfection, simplicity, and naturalness. This philosophy is particularly appropriate for disaster response applications because it:
- **Promotes calmness** during stressful emergencies through understated design
- **Emphasizes functionality** over decoration, ensuring clear communication
- **Embraces simplicity** to reduce cognitive load when users need information quickly

### Color Palette
We carefully selected colors that reflect wabi-sabi principles while maintaining usability:

| Color | Purpose | Psychological Impact |
|-------|---------|---------------------|
| **Navy Blue (#1a2332)** | Primary background, headers | Trust, stability, authority - reassuring during crises |
| **Off-White (#f8f9fa)** | Content backgrounds | Clean, neutral canvas that doesn't strain eyes |
| **Soft Gray (#94a3b8)** | Secondary elements, borders | Gentle contrast without harshness |
| **Accent Red (#dc2626)** | Alerts, warnings | Immediate attention for critical information |
| **Accent Green (#16a34a)** | Safety confirmations, resources | Reassurance, positive actions |
| **Accent Blue (#2563eb)** | Interactive elements, information | Clarity, trust, navigation |

### Typography
- **Font Family**: Roboto with Japanese fallback (Noto Sans JP)
- **Font Weights**: 200-500 range for subtle hierarchy
- **Line Height**: 1.6-1.8 for comfortable reading during stress
- **Letter Spacing**: Increased for headers to create breathing room

### Subtle Animations
Animations are designed to be **gentle and purposeful**, never distracting:
- **Button hover effects**: Slight elevation and glow to confirm interactivity
- **Ripple effect**: Subtle feedback on button clicks
- **Fade-in transitions**: Smooth 0.6s ease-in for page loads
- **Slide-in messages**: 0.4s animation for chat messages
- **Transform on hover**: 2-3px translateY for depth perception

All animations respect **prefers-reduced-motion** settings for accessibility.

### Responsive Design
- **Mobile-first approach**: Optimized for phones (primary device during emergencies)
- **Breakpoint at 768px**: Seamless transition between mobile and desktop
- **Touch-friendly targets**: Minimum 44px tap areas for buttons
- **Flexible layouts**: Content adapts gracefully to all screen sizes
